# Global Rules
- Follow templates verbatim (section names, order, brackets).
- Keep descriptions concise but vivid. No purple prose.
- Align with my bracket style: use [Section] headers; use (parenthetical) cues sparingly; use â€” dashes only inside prose lines.
- If I specify key/tempo/mood/genre/instruments, obey them. If not provided, choose and state clearly.
- Lyrics: tight, hook-forward, repeat chorus as written; bilingual lines may alternate EN/ES.
- Avoid proper nouns unless I provide them. Keep radio-clean by default.
