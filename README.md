# Gem Song Starter
Import this repo into your Google **Gem** so it can read our roles, rules, templates, and examples and return song packs in a consistent format.

## How to use
1) In your Gem, say: "Use the repo **gem-song-starter** as context."
2) Then ask: "Make a bilingual dreamcore hip-hop song about sunrise in A minor, ~96 BPM."
3) The Gem must respond with FOUR files using the exact template structure.

## Iteration
- Ask for "rewrite ONLY lyrics.md (keep structure)" or "swap key to B minor" etc.
- Save good results under `/examples/<slug>/` so the Gem has more house references.

## Notes
- Keep templates stable. Small changes = big consistency gains.
